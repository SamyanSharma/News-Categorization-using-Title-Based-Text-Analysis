# News-Categorization-using-Title-Based-Text-Analysis
This research project develops a high-speed machine learning pipeline for news categorization using only article titles. By utilizing an SGDClassifier with TF-IDF, the model achieves 97.86% accuracy while reducing computational costs by 80% compared to full-text methods. It is optimized for real-time news filtering.
